# blahajOS
blahajOS is an open-source, work-in-progress operating system for the EMT64/AMD64 platform.
This is based on the [Limine Bare Bones](https://wiki.osdev.org/Limine_Bare_Bones) tutorial from the OSDev wiki, and as the name implies it uses the Limine bootloader.

## Roadmap:
- [ ] General:
- - [ ] Enter Protected/Long Mode for full memory access

- [ ] Kernel:
- - [ ] Memory management
- - [ ] Serial output
